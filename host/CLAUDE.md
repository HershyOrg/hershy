This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Hersh** is a reactive framework for Go that implements a Reducer-Effect pattern for building reactive applications with monitoring and control capabilities. The framework is designed around deterministic state management with Watch-based reactivity.

## Implementation Guide

Before implementation, you must create a plan and have it reviewed.

Implementation shall be carried out in a single Phase, and the Phase must be defined as As Is → To Be.

Break the Phase down step by step, create a plan, and then implement accordingly.

Follow Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and use granular, semantically meaningful types.

During implementation, you must validate the work by following the Verification Guide.

## Verification Guide

After implementation, run and verify all builds and tests within the package.

Confirm that the implementation matches the Phase’s As Is and To Be defined in the plan.

Confirm that you did not “shortcut” by pretending to implement the To Be without actually doing so.

### Core Framework Design: Reducer-Effect Pattern

Hersh implements a **synchronous Reducer-Effect architecture** where all state transitions are deterministic and effects execute synchronously after state changes. This design ensures:

1. **Deterministic execution**: No race conditions, predictable behavior
2. **Synchronous flow**: Reducer → Commander → Handler (sequential, not concurrent)
3. **Signal-based reactivity**: Priority-ordered signal processing
4. **Fault tolerance**: Built-in recovery policies with exponential backoff

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Watcher
The main orchestrator that:
- Creates and manages the Manager
- Provides the public API (`Manage`, `Start`, `Stop`, `SendMessage`)
- Handles Watch variable registration
- Coordinates lifecycle (initialization, running, cleanup)

#### 2. Manager (Reducer-Effect Engine)
Coordinates three core components synchronously:
- **Reducer**: Processes signals and performs state transitions
- **EffectCommander**: Maps state changes to effects (synchronous)
- **EffectHandler**: Executes effects and runs the ManagedFunc (synchronous)

Signal flow: `Signal → Reducer → Commander → Handler → (WatcherSig?) → loop`

#### 3. Signals (Priority-Based)
Three signal types with priority ordering:
- **WatcherSig** (Priority 0): State control (InitRun, Stop, Kill, Recover)
- **UserSig** (Priority 1): User messages triggering ManagedFunc execution
- **VarSig** (Priority 2): Watch variable updates triggering reactive execution

#### 4. State Machine
States: `Ready → InitRun → Running → Ready` (normal flow)
Terminal states: `Stopped`, `Killed`, `Crashed`
Recovery: `Running → WaitRecover → Ready` (on failure)

#### 5. Watch Variables (Reactive Primitives)
- **WatchCall**: Tick-based polling with computation functions
  - Returns `VarUpdateFunc` that computes next state from previous state
  - State-dependent execution (sequential processing)
- **WatchFlow**: Channel-based event streaming
  - Pushes values directly from channels
  - State-independent execution (uses last value only)

#### 6. ManagedFunc
User-defined function that:
- Receives `Message` and `HershContext`
- Can use Watch, Memo, and context values
- Returns control flow errors (`StopError`, `KillError`, `CrashError`)
- Triggers re-execution when Watch variables change

#### 7. Effects
Effects represent side effects that occur after state transitions:
- **UserRun**: Execute ManagedFunc with user message
- **VarUpdate**: Apply VarUpdateFunc to update watched variable
- **StateTransition**: Handle state lifecycle changes
- **Recovery**: Implement fault tolerance with exponential backoff

### Initialization Flow

1. User creates `Watcher` with config
2. User calls `Manage(fn, name)` to register ManagedFunc
3. User calls `Start()` which:
   - Starts Manager components (Reducer loop)
   - Sends `InitRun` signal
   - Executes ManagedFunc for first time (registers Watch variables)
   - Waits for all Watch variables to initialize
   - Transitions to `Ready` state
4. Framework enters reactive loop

### Reactive Execution Flow

1. Watch variable detects change (tick or channel event)
2. Watch loop sends `VarSig` to Manager
3. Reducer processes `VarSig` (priority-based)
4. Reducer calls EffectCommander to generate effects
5. EffectCommander returns `VarUpdate` effect
6. Reducer calls EffectHandler to execute effect synchronously
7. EffectHandler applies `VarUpdateFunc`, updates state
8. If value changed, EffectHandler generates `UserRun` effect
9. EffectHandler executes ManagedFunc with updated context
10. ManagedFunc reads new Watch values, performs logic
11. Cycle repeats on next Watch change

### Error Handling & Fault Tolerance

**Control Flow Errors**: Special errors for state control
- `StopError`: Gracefully stop (can be recovered)
- `KillError`: Terminate immediately (permanent)
- `CrashError`: Unrecoverable error (permanent)

**Recovery Policy**: Configurable fault tolerance
- **Suppression Phase** (failures < MinConsecutiveFailures): Exponential backoff with `SuppressDelay`
- **Recovery Phase** (failures ≥ MinConsecutiveFailures): Enter `WaitRecover` state, retry with `BaseRetryDelay`
- **Crash** (failures ≥ MaxConsecutiveFailures): Enter `Crashed` state (permanent)

**Deterministic Cleanup**: No timeouts
- Uses channels (`cleanupDone`, `WaitStopped`) for synchronization
- Guaranteed cleanup completion before shutdown
